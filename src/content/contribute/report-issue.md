## Posting an issue

Before posting an issue, prepare a log file, taken, after you reproduce the bug.
[Follow instructions here]({{%relref "log.md"%}})

Please, *always*, provide a log file if you encounter a bug, even if you think if is obvious to you. 
Sometimes it is useful to make a screenshot of a bug, or even a screencast, if addon acts _strange_ in your understanding.
